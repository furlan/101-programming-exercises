Exercise 60: Roulette Payouts
(Solved—45 Lines)
Aroulette wheel has 38 spaces on it. Of these spaces, 18 are black, 18 are red, and two
are green. The green spaces are numbered 0 and 00. The red spaces are numbered 1,
3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 14, 16, 18, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 30 32, 34 and 36. The remaining integers
between 1 and 36 are used to number the black spaces.
Many different bets can be placed in roulette.We will only consider the following
subset of them in this exercise:
• Single number (1 to 36, 0, or 00)
• Red versus Black
• Odd versus Even (Note that 0 and 00 do not pay out for even)
• 1 to 18 versus 19 to 36
Write a program that simulates a spin of a roulette wheel by using Python’s random
number generator. Display the number that was selected and all of the bets that must
be payed. For example, if 13 is selected then your program should display:
The spin resulted in 13...
Pay 13
Pay Black
Pay Odd
Pay 1 to 18
If the simulation results in 0 or 00 then your program should display Pay 0 or
Pay 00 without any further output.


Exercise 61:Average
(26 Lines)
In this exercise you will create a program that computes the average of a collection
of values entered by the user. The user will enter 0 as a sentinel value to indicate
that no further values will be provided. Your program should display an appropriate
error message if the first value entered by the user is 0.
Hint: Because the 0 marks the end of the input it should not be included in the
average.


Exercise - ATM Cash dispenser

Receive a value from the user and return the bills the dispenser should make available to the user.

Available bills: 10, 50, 100i


Exercise 69:Approximate πx
(23 Lines)
The value of π can be approximated by the following infinite series:
π ≈ 3+ 4
2 × 3 × 4
− 4
4 × 5 × 6
+ 4
6 × 7 × 8
− 4
8 × 9 × 10
+ 4
10 × 11 × 12
−· · ·
Write a program that displays 15 approximations of π. The first approximation
shouldmake use of only the first term from the infinite series. Each additional approximation
displayed by your program should include one more term in the series, making
it a better approximation of π than any of the approximations displayed previously.i


Exercise 72: Is a String a Palindrome?
(Solved—23 Lines)
A string is a palindrome if it is identical forward and backward. For example “anna”,
“civic”, “level” and “hannah” are all examples of palindromicwords. Write a program
that reads a string from the user and uses a loop to determines whether or not it is a
palindrome. Display the result, including a meaningful output message.
